Lenn Heida Barbershop is a local business that needed a website for his (potential) customers.
The design, logo, video and font was already picked by Lenn Heida.

Requirements:

- Landing page custom video that enlarges on scroll motion
- Section about Lenn Heida himself
- Section about the barbershop
- Section with impressions (photos)
- Contact details
- Mobile friendly
- Ability for customers to make an appointment (integration with Salonized)
- Lenn Heida wanted to be able to manage the website himself.

To get up and running fast and to have a management portal I proposed _Wordpress_.
With _Elementor Pro_ I was able to make the design suggested by Lenn Heida myself.

**Result**: [Lenn Heida Barbershop](https://lennheidabarbershop.nl)
